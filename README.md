## Redshift Data Warehouse Project

### Introduction
For this project I build an **ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift**, a Data Warehouse service in the AWS cloud. It was part of my *[Udacity Nanodegree in Data Engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027)*.

### The Task
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### The Dataset
The database is based on two datasets. 
- **The song dataset** `(s3://udacity-dend/song_data)` is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
- **The logfile dataset** `(s3://udacity-dend/log_data)` consists of log files in JSON format generated by an [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the song dataset. It simulates activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files are partitioned by year and month.
**The log data JSON path:** `(s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json)`
